# Memento Mori



Memento Mori is a dapp that lets you create a will for your Safe wallet. You may designate beneficiaries for your native, ERC20, ERC7721 and ERC1155 tokens and assign a percentage to each of them. Upon your death beneficiaries may request execution. If you do not cancel execution before the cooldown period is over beneficiaries may execute the will and receive their assets. Uses Chainlink CCIP to enable wills on multiple chains executed by a single. NOTE: This version is meant to run inside an I-frame on the Gnosis Safe website.
